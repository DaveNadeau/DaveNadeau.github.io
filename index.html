            <p class="bolderFont">Hi there - I'm Dave.  Thanks for dropping by to take a look at my site. Actually, this version of my portoflio site has
              been created as a submission to a coding challenge from Andrei Neagoie's "Zero to Mastery" course in web development.  It
              has been a great learning experience.  Because of this, I have some great ideas on what the next iteration of this page
              should feel like.  But don't worry, I don't just design my own website over and over again- I have some other projects to
              show you as well. <br>  Welcome!</p>

            <p class="bolderFont">Since I'm not writing an autobiography I'll keep this simple.  I love creating things.  From a not-so-humble beginning as
            a wanna-be actor (read: handyman and carpenter) to earning a B.S. in computer science, my life has taken more than a few turns.
            But one thing has remained constant- the drive and passion to create. <br> <br> As you'll see from my varied projects,  I have
            experience with C++, Javascript, and a bit of C# as well as HTML5 and CSS3. I consider myself a perpetual student of coding and
            design and continue to develop as a... well, developer.  With a solid foundation in programming and a knack for aesthetics, I
            see myself as a generalist with a desire to specialize. <br> <br> In order to discover where my path will lead- I keep coding.
            I have several projects in the works.  For a sneak peak, feel free to visit my <a href="https://github.com/DaveNadeau"
            target="_blank">GitHub</a>  page. <br><br> I am currently employed as an IT Supervisor, gaining useful knowledge about networking
            and business technologies, but my passion remains with design and development.  When I'm not coding or working I enjoy playing with
            my two kids (6 and 2), playing music, and occassionally still play video games.  Although, with two young kids and a fierce coding
            habit, there is less and less time for gaming- I'd rather build them. <br><br> Anyway, too much talking.  Let's get down to business!...

                  Details: Another (you guessed it) student project. The challenge here was to create a very basic AI. With an emphasis on the
                  "basic," we accomplished the task and created a fun little game. It's a code breaking game in the style of "Mastermind", wherein
                  one guesses at a 4 digit code, if the number isn't in the code the computer returns N (nothing).  If the number is in the code but
                  in the wrong location, we get C (cow) returned.  Finally if the number is correct and in the right sequence, the number is given a
                  (B) bull!  It was interesting to delve into the very basic level of AI and something I hope to work on again!  That being said I do
                  want to come back to this at some point and add a bit more intelligence to the artificial... enjoy!</p>

                <h1 class="resName">Dave Nadeau</h1>
                <p class="res-defaultText">Having obtained a B.S. in Game and Simulation Programming, I have a solid foundation in Object Oriented
                  Programming with a mid-level programming language (C++) as well as an eye toward design.  Numerous certificates
                  also speak to my thirst for knowledge and skills in a wide range of development.  I see myself as a generalist
                  with a desire to specialize.

                <p class="resNameHeader">Astroman</p>
                <p class="resDuties">Programmer(C++)/HUD Designer/Character Design and Animation <br>
                  Resources: Unreal Engine, 3DS Max, Photoshop
                </p>
                <p class="res-defaultText">This was a student project.  A team of four, we created a space themed first person shooter
                  with horde-style gameplay.  Implementing the HUD was integral to the look and feel of the game and proved an arduous
                  process.  Along with some great lessons learned in coding and debugging, I learned about letting go of ideas in the
                  spirit of collaboration.  I was also the sole animator of the group, creating original models, then rigging and animating
                  them.

                <p class="resNameHeader">Dreadgulch Valley</p>
                <p class="resDuties">Programmer (C#)/3D modeling/Cinema Scenes <br>
                  Resources: Unity, 3DS Max, Photoshop, Audacity
                </p>
                <p class="res-defaultText">Another student project and again a team of four, we were able to assemble this alien western
                  story with multiple levels in a very short 8 weeks.  I created many models for this game, but the crown jewel was the
                  space ship and its cinema scene.  While I did spend a great deal of time in that role, it was also my first exposure to
                  the C# language.  Because of that, I cast myself into debugging. In my experience thus far, there is no better way to
                  learn the subtleties of a language while deepening your understanding of core concepts than debugging bad code.
